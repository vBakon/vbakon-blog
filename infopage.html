                <p>vBakon is an alter-ego that came to be with the need to create a professional portfolio. It was created by me, Vicente Pinho, a Portuguese artist. After finishing my course on Game Design and Digital Animation, at the Superior School of Media, Arts and Design (ESMAD), I decided on developing a brand under which I would publish my artwork, professional and academic accomplishments.</p>

            <div class="about-2">
                <p>Aiming to, one day, become a conceptual artist, I studied animation in high school, at the Artistic School of Soares dos Reis (Escola Art√≠stica de Soares dos Reis), making my first short film, "De(il)lusion". Later, in college, I got the opportunity to develop more of my sense of narrative, character creation, animation, and 3D techniques, developing, during that process, my first 3 videogames: "Perpetual", "Heartless", and "Cyber Circus".</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-3">
                <p>Throughout my 5 years studying arts, both in high school and in college I learned to work in a diversity of art styles and with a variety of programs. I learned photography, illustration, and 2D animation, using the programs Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Animate, and Adobe After Effects; video editing, through the programs Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere; 3D modeling and animation, with the software 3Ds Max, Maya, and Blender; music and sound production with the use of Reaper and Ableton Live; finally, I used the engines Unity and Godot during the development of the games I've worked on so far.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-4">
                <p>This journey led me to consolidate my love for character design and enhance my enjoyment of the world of animation and video games. With the end of my curricular journey and after my internship at FABAMAQ, all that was left was to take the next step and kickstart the next big era of my life: get a job. And with that goal in mind, came the development of a professional portfolio and the development of some of the work seen in this blog. If you are reading this, I hope you enjoy my artwork and thank you very much!</p>
